# English-alphabet-character-voice-frequency-encoder
This DSP project entails developing a system for encoding and decoding English alphabets using voice-frequency signals. Initially, an encoder will transform each letter into a unique set of frequencies. Subsequently, a decoder will convert these frequencies back into text.
