# English-Voice-Frequency Encoding & Decoding System


## Overview
This DSP project entails developing a system for encoding and decoding English alphabets using voice-frequency signals. Initially, an encoder will transform each letter into a unique set of frequencies. Subsequently, a decoder will convert these frequencies back into text.  This project aims to develop a system for encoding and decoding English alphabet characters using voice-frequency signals. It focuses on creating an encoder to convert each letter into a unique set of frequencies and a decoder to interpret these frequencies back into text.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
- Run the encoder: `python main.py encode <input_string>`.
- Run the decoder: `python main.py decode <input_signal>`.
